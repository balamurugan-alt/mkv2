        • For a kick of spice, double the black pepper in this green bean casserole recipe to 1/4 teaspoon and prepare as directed.<br />
        • To feed a crowd, double the recipe and prepare in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Use an entire 6-ounce container of Crispy Fried Onions, reserving 1 1/3 cup for the topping. Increase cooking time to 40 minutes or until heated through.<br />
        • If using fresh or frozen green beans, make sure to cook them first! Blanch fresh green beans until tender, or steam frozen beans as directed on package. </span>
